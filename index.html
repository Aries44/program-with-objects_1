     <b>Coding in HTML</b>
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
      <p>
       Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote.

     <b>Programming</b>
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
      <p>
       A <b>computer</b> is a machine that can execute a program. With the right program, a computer can do any mechanical computation you can imagine.
      </p>
      <p>
       A <b>program</b> describes a very precise sequence of steps. Since the computer is just a machine, the program must give the steps in a way that can be executed mechanically. That is, the program can be followed without any thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       A <b>programming language</b> is a language designed for producing computer programs. A good programming language makes it easy for humans to read and write programs that can be executed by a computer.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b> Python</b> is a programming language. The programs that we write in the python language will be the input to the python interpreter, which is a program that runs on the computer. The Python interpreter reads our programs and executes them by following the rules of the Python language.

    <div class="concept-description">
      <p>
       Basic HTML involves using Tags, Elements and Attributes within the code to make your webpage more user friendly and appealing. Tags can change the appearance of words from normal test to something else for example <em> HTML stands for Hypertext Markup</em>. Elements are everything from the start tag through the end tag.

      <p>
       HTML is the widely used markup language for web pages. It provides the structure of text information in a <b>document</b> so that certain text will be labeled as headings or paragraphs. It will also allow for embedded images and other objects to be supplemented for text.

       Programmers need to try and avoid repetition. When they don't, this may lead to copying and pasting certain style attributes into many HTML elements. Programmers need to be consistent so that every lesson will look the same.

   <div class="concept" id="lesson-4-1"> 
    <div class="concept-title">
     <b>Variables</b>
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
      <p>
       A <b>variable</b> is a name that refers to a value. In Python, we can use any sequence of letters and numbers and underscores (_) we want to make a variable name, so long as it does not start with a number. For example:
      </p> 
        <p>
         <em>Decia_stage2</em><br>
         <em>Sooners</em><br>
         <em>Student15</em>
        </p>         
      <p>
       We can introduce a new variable by using an assignment statement. Once the program executes the assignment expression, the variable name will refer to the value of the expression on the right side of the assignment.  We can use the variable name anywhere we want and it will mean the same thing as the value it refers to. 
      </p> 
        <p>
         <em>Test_of_speed = 435</em>
        </p> 
    </div>
   </div>
   <div class="concept" id="lesson-4-2">
    <div class="concept-title">
     <b>Variables Can Vary</b>
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
      <p>
       The value a variable refers to can change. When a variable name is used, it always refers to the last value assigned to that variable. Since the value that a variable refers to can change, the same exact expression can have different values at different times depending on when it was executed.
      </p>
      <p>
       This gets more interesting when we use the same variable on both sides of an assignment. The right side is evaluated first, using the current value of the variable. Then the assignment is done using that value. In the following expressions, the value of hours changes from 9 to 10 and then to 20 as the expression changes:
      </p>
        <p>
         Hours = 9<br>
         Hours = Hours + 1      #after the assignment, Hours refers to 10<br>
         Hours = Hours * 2      #after the assignment, Hours refers to 20
        </p>
      <p>
       It is important to remember that although we use = for assignment it does not mean equality. You should think of the = sign in Python as an arrow,            , showing that the value the right side evaluates to is being assigned to the variable name on the left side.

     <b>Strings</b>
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
      <p>
       A <b>string</b> is a sequence of characters surrounded by quotes; either single or double. The only requirement is that the string must start and end with the same kind of quote. This allows you to include quotes inside of quotes as a character in the string.
      </p> 
         <p><em>name = ‘Decia’ or “Decia”</em><br>
           <em>print name</em><br>
           <em>print ‘Hello’ + name</em>

     <b>Operators on Strings</b>
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
      <p>
       We can also use the plus sign operator (+) on strings, but it has a different meaning from when it is used on numbers. With string, plus sign means concatenation which is the joining of character strings from end-to-end. However, you cannot use the plus sign operator to combine strings and integers. If you do, you will get an error message once the program runs.
      </p> 
        <p>
         <em>name = ‘Decia’</em><br>
         <em>print name</em><br>
         <em>print ‘Hello’ + name</em><br>

     <b>Sub-Sequences from Strings</b>
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
      <p>
       You can select a sub-sequence of a string by designating a starting position and an end position. Python reads the characters positions starting at 0, so that if we consider the string ‘Project’ that has 8 characters, then ‘P’ would be in the 0 position. If the start expression is missing, the sub-sequence starts from the beginning of the string. If the end expression is missing, the sub-sequence goes to the end of the string.
      </p> 
        <p>
         <em>(string){start expression:end expression}</em><br>
         <em>city = ‘Atlanta’</em><br>
         <em>print city[3:6]</em><br>

     <b>Finding  Strings in Strings</b>
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
      <p>
       The <b>find method</b> is a built in operation, or method, provided by Python, that operates on strings to search within a given string for a particular target expression. The output of the find is the position of the string where the specified sub-string is found. If the target string is not found anywhere in the search string, then the output will be -1.
      </p> 
        <p> 
         <em>string = ‘Stage two project is for Stage two Udacity’</em><br>
         <em>print string.find(‘Stage’)</em><br>
         <em>0</em>
        </p>  
      <p>
       The <b>find method</b> can also pass in a number as well as a target expression. The <em>number</em> input is the position in the search string where the find will start looking for the target string. The output is a number giving the position of the first occurrence of the target string in the search string at or after the number input position. If there is no occurrence at or after that position, the output is -1.
      </p> 
        <p>
         <em>string = ‘Stage two project is for Stage two Udacity’</em><br>
         <em>print string.find(‘Stage’, 5)</em><br>

     <b>Control Flow If and While Loops</b>
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
      <p>
       Control flow is a way to control the execution of the program statements so that it will behave as the programmer intended. One way Python programming uses this is through “If statements” and “While Loops”. If statements will evaluate the value of the first expression to see if it is <b>“True”</b>, and if <b>“True”</b> the second expression will not be evaluated. If the first expression value is evaluated to be <b>“False”</b>, the value will become the second expression value.  On the other hand, While Loops will continue to repeat the programming statements until an evaluation of <b>False</b> is returned.
      </p> 
        <p>
         <b>Example of If Statement:</b><br>
         if a&gtc:<br>
         return a<br>
         else:<br>
         return c
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>Example of While Loop:</b><br>
          i = 0<br>
          while i&lt10:<br> 
          print i<br>
          i = i + 1

       This is the hinding of details in programming which is powerful due to it allows the programmer to concentrate on the program we want to write. It impowers us to use these functions by simply reading or calling their documentation within our programs. Such as:

       Classes are essentially a template or blueprint to create your objects. You can view it as a neatly packaged box that puts things together really well. Classes calls a function called __init__ which is considered as a "Constructor" because it initializes or creates space and memory for a new object or instance within the program.
